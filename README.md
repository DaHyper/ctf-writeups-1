# CTF Writeups

Welcome to the my CTF writeups Repository! This is a collection of my solutions and explanations for various Capture The Flag (CTF) and security challenges. 

## What is this repository for?

This repository aims to serve as a resource for those attempting the CTF challenges I've detailed on here. In each writeup, I aim to explain the underlying concepts behind each challenge in an intuitive and abstract manner.
